# I'm Tim. Nice to meet you!

I'm a data scientist, a former economic consultant at Charles River Associates, and a two-time Berkeley grad.

As a consultant at CRA, all of my data analysis was relevant to antitrust litigation; it was subject to cross-examination by a hostile opposition in court. This past experience serves me well as a data scientist; my analysis is carefully considered, robust, and comprehensive.

I'm passionate about opportunities to use data to answer tough questions with real impact. Check out a sample of my educational and independent projects, which include:

- :house: :heavy_dollar_sign: An investigation of pricing algorithms' impact in the rental housing market, where my team and I identified an average increase in rent of $200/month.
- :page_facing_up: :ballot_box_with_check: Survey research which found that Americans' political opinions may change if questions are posed in a social media context.
- :earth_americas: :zap: A website which demonstrates relationships between climate change impacts and natural disasters in the United States.
- :computer: :soccer: A Computer Vision/Object Detection model which can locate a soccer ball & players in images of soccer matches.
